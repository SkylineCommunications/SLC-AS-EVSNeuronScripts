# SLC-AS-EVSNeuronScript

This Interactive Automation Script (IAS) allows the user to update Video Path configurations at once. 
The user selects the video path to edit on the dropdown at the top and it shows the actual values. The user would apply/discard the changes using the "Apply" and "Cancel" buttons. The values allowed to edit/update are:

Delays: 
- Frame Delay
- Vertical Delay
- Horizontal Delay

Color Corrections:
- Gain Red
- Gain Green
- Gain Blue
- Blacklevel Red
- Blacklevel Green
- Blacklevel Blue

This is how the IAS is displayed on an App:
